PYSCX
====================================

Welcome to the documentation for the **pyscx** library!

**pyscx** is a wrapper library designed for interacting with the STALCRAFT:X API.  
In this documentation, you will find detailed information on how to use **pyscx**,  
a comprehensive description of its features, as well as usage examples  
that illustrate the main idea behind the creation of this library.

.. warning::
   Some functions currently available in **pyscx** may not work as expected or may function incorrectly.  
   This is because the STALCRAFT:X API is currently in the early ``beta v1.0.0``,  
   and for this reason, some functions may behave unexpectedly or not work at all.  

   If you encounter any issues, even those not directly related to **pyscx**,  
   please report them to the `Bug Tracker <https://github.com/Oidaho/pyscx/issues>`_.
